                    <p>
                        This is the first darshan of the day. The name Mangla underlines auspiciousness
                        of beginning the day with a glimpse of lord. In winter this darshan takes place
                        before sunrise, while in summer, it is later. During Mangla darshan, the main doors
                        of the sanctum are kept closed and are only opened after the customary initial rituals.
                        This ensures that the drowsy divine child is not startled by large crowds rushing
                        in to see him. It also accords with the mood of the darshan, which is bala bhava,
                        the feelings of a parent concerned about a child's well - being another idea underlying
                        the closed doors is that the svarupa should not be tempted to play with his young
                        companions as opening doors might tempt him to run out! In summer, Shrinathji is
                        clad simply in an adbandha, a light dhoti. In winter, he keeps warm with a quilted
                        coat. His flute is not placed in his hand, for it is felt that if he were to play
                        it early in the morning, everyone would be enchanted and all work would come to
                        a standstill! Arti is offered to Shrinathji during this darshana. This ritual banishes
                        the evil spirits which hover around in the darkness of the night, seeking to cause
                        harm. This morning darshana is dedicated to the memory of paramandadas, one of the
                        asthachhapa poets. The kiratans Sung at this time are in one of the classical morning
                        ragas - Lalita, Bhairava or Vibhasa. d are only opened after the customary initial
                        rituals.

                        The next darshana follows the first by hour and is called shringara. Shrinathji
                        is dressed carefully from head to foot, and a garland of flowers is placed around
                        his neck. A Mukhiya holds a mirror in front of him so that he can satisfy himself
                        that, he is well dressed. This is his play hour like that of any other child, and
                        he is offered dry fruits and sweets representing food brought to him by his beloved
                        gopis. This explains why he is called gopivallabha. It is only after this meal that
                        Shrinathji's flute is placed in his hand, so that he can delight Swamiji - Shri
                        Radha - with the tunes she loves. The ragas sung during this darshana are Ramakali,
                        Gunakali and Bilaval. The poet Nandadas is considered the main singer.

                        Third darshana takes place at the hour when the lord takes his cows to pasture.
                        The Mukhiya of the Gaushala (Cowpen) of Nathdwara visits Shrinathji at this time
                        to inform him that all his Cows are well. He is then offered makhan mishri, a light
                        dish with a milk base. The refreshments offered at gwala darshana have to be light,
                        since the lord is believed to have already eaten the comparatively rich foods offered
                        to him by the gopis earlier. Neither flowers nor his flute are shown during this
                        darshana it is assumed that he will be playing with his cowherd friends.

                        The main meal of the day is offered to Shrinathji at Rajabhoga. Vitthalnathji, the
                        son of the founder of Pushti Marga, has planned this as the most elaborate darshana
                        of all. A temple priest ascends to the terrace prior to the darshana and calls out,
                        'Mala Begi Laiyo!!' (bring the garland quickly). This loud call heard over a wide
                        area, dates back to the time when Shrinathji was at Mount Govardhana. The flower
                        garden of the temple used to be located at Chandra Sarovar, Nathdwara. 'The call
                        for the Garland' is the signal for the darshan to be opened to the crowds waiting
                        to catch a glimpse of the lord. The rhythmic sound of drums is heard, excitement
                        mounts, and the doors are flung open. Shrinathji is seen in all his regal splendor,
                        holding lotus in one hand and wearing an elaborate garland. Beeda (folded betal
                        leaves containing spices), are placed near him, along with a pitcher of water, his
                        beloved flute, cane to play with Genda (Ball) and a mirror. Fine perfumes are sprinkled
                        over the kalash on the roof, and the air is redolent with its scent. At the end
                        of this darshana the load retires for three hours. This period is known as Anavasara.
                        Recalling his siestas with Swaminiji in meadows of Vrindavana. The chief kirtanakara
                        of this darshana is Kumbhanadas.

                        During the afternoon, around 3.30 p.m., Shrinathji is aroused from his nap. A Conch
                        is blown, it is time for him to return home with his Cows. The vina is played followed
                        by kirtana. Surdas, the celebrated blind devotee, mystic and poet, is supposed to
                        be the chief singer of this darshana.

                        Sixth darshana of the day takes place an hour after Utthapana. A light meal is served
                        to Shrinathji. A Chhadidara stands guard formally dressed in a Pagha (Turban), a
                        Pataka (Sash) and a Gheradar Jama (A Garment with a Flaring Skirt). He holds a staff
                        and wears a golden kada, anklet. The Chhadidara's function is to inform Swaminiji
                        of Shrinathji's arrival, so that she can obtain his darshana and arrange to milk
                        the Cows. Shrinathji is fanned and a morchhala is waved beside him to remove the
                        possible effects of the evil eye cast while he has been in full view of many people.
                        The main singer for this period is Chaturbhuadas.

                        Sandhya Aarti is the evening darshana. This darshana takes place at dusk, when krishna
                        use to bring his Cows home from the fields. The predominant mood is matrubhava (motherly
                        love). The fear of any ill effects resulting from his wonderings in the woods and
                        protects from harm. After the day’s exertions, his garments now are light. He is
                        offered his flute so that he can enchant his devotees and his Cowherd friends. To
                        signal end of the day, sudarshana chakra on the roof of the haveli is offered consecrated
                        food, and the seven Dhvajas (flags) are wrapped round their sticks until the next
                        day. Chhitaswami is considered the chief musician for this darshana.

                        Final Darshana of the day commences only after rasoiya boli, when the priest ascends
                        the terrace of the haveli and calls out - Cook, come early the following day. After
                        this, drumming heralds Darshana. Since it is time for Lord to retire, various eatables
                        are offered to Shrinathji. A singer praises lord in his kiratana, which may take
                        form of an expression of a beloved's emotion and is offered to both Shrinathji and
                        Swaminiji. Paan-Beeda (betal leaves with spices) are again offered to him. As Shrinathji
                        is about to retire for the night, various arrangements have to be made. His bed
                        chameber is readied for him, with a container of food, a pitcher of drinking water
                        and Paan-Beedas. It is supposed that Shri Radha will join him during the night,
                        her garments and jewels too are kept in readiness. A carpet is spread on the ground
                        leads from the image of Shrinathji to his bed chamber. It is presumed that he will
                        walk on it in his spiritual, subtle form. The wooden platforms places in Doltibari
                        for the devotees to stand on during darshanas are removed. This ensures that Shrinathji
                        does not encounter any obstacles at night. To enjoy his lilas with his beloved gopis,
                        if he desires the canopies stretched over the open courtyards to protect people
                        from the scorching afternoon sun are also removed. This darshana is usually not
                        held for the six months, from Chaitra Shukla 1 to Ashvin Shukla 9, when Shrinathji
                        is suppose to visit Vraja and reveal himself to the Vrajavasis(residents of vraja).
                        The chief singer of this darshana is Krishanadas.
