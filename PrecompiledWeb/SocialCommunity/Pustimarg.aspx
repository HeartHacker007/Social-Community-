                Darshan :: Mangla</h5>
            <p>
                This is the first darshan of the day. The name Mangla underlines auspiciousness
                of beginning the day with a glimpse of lord. In winter this darshan takes place
                before sunrise, while in summer, it is later. During Mangla darshan, the main doors
                of the sanctum are kept closed and are only opened after the customary initial rituals.

                Darshan :: Shringar
            </h5>
            <p>
                The next darshana follows the first by hour and is called shringara. Shrinathji
                is dressed carefully from head to foot, and a garland of flowers is placed around
                his neck. A Mukhiya holds a mirror in front of him so that he can satisfy himself
                that, he is well dressed. This is his play hour like that of any other child, and
                he is offered dry fruits and sweets representing food brought to him by his beloved
                gopis.

                Darshan :: Gwal
            </h5>
            <p>
                Third darshana takes place at the hour when the lord takes his cows to pasture.
                The Mukhiya of the Gaushala (Cowpen) of Nathdwara visits Shrinathji at this time
                to inform him that all his Cows are well. He is then offered makhan mishri, a light
                dish with a milk base. The refreshments offered at gwala darshana have to be light,
                since the lord is believed to have already eaten the comparatively rich foods offered
                to him by the gopis earlier.</p>

            <h5>
                Darshan :: Rajbhog</h5>
            <p>
                The main meal of the day is offered to Shrinathji at Rajabhoga. Vitthalnathji, the
                son of the founder of Pushti Marga, has planned this as the most elaborate darshana
                of all. A temple priest ascends to the terrace prior to the darshana and calls out,
                'Mala Begi Laiyo!!' (bring the garland quickly). This loud call heard over a wide
                area, dates back to the time when Shrinathji was at Mount Govardhana. The flower
                garden of the temple used to be located at Chandra Sarovar, Nathdwara.</p>

            <h5>
                Darshan :: Utthapan</h5>
            <p>
                During the afternoon, around 3.30 p.m., Shrinathji is aroused from his nap. A Conch
                is blown, it is time for him to return home with his Cows. The vina is played followed
                by kirtana. Surdas, the celebrated blind devotee, mystic and poet, is supposed to
                be the chief singer of this darshana.

            <h5>
                Darshan :: Bhog
            </h5>
            <p>
                Sixth darshana of the day takes place an hour after Utthapana. A light meal is served
                to Shrinathji. A Chhadidara stands guard formally dressed in a Pagha (Turban), a
                Pataka (Sash) and a Gheradar Jama (A Garment with a Flaring Skirt). He holds a staff
                and wears a golden kada, anklet. The Chhadidara's function is to inform Swaminiji
                of Shrinathji's arrival, so that she can obtain his darshana and arrange to milk
                the Cows.

                Darshan :: Aarti
            </h5>
            <p>
                Sandhya Aarti is the evening darshana. This darshana takes place at dusk, when krishna
                use to bring his Cows home from the fields. The predominant mood is matrubhava (motherly
                love). The fear of any ill effects resulting from his wonderings in the woods and
                protects from harm. After the day’s exertions, his garments now are light.</p>

            <h5>
                Darshan :: Shayan</h5>
            <p>
                Final Darshana of the day commences only after rasoiya boli, when the priest ascends
                the terrace of the haveli and calls out - Cook, come early the following day. After
                this, drumming heralds Darshana. Since it is time for Lord to retire, various eatables
                are offered to Shrinathji. A singer praises lord in his kiratana, which may take
                form of an expression of a beloved's emotion and is offered to both Shrinathji and
                Swaminiji.
