                History</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Nagar Bandhara Community</strong> from Saurashtra traces history back to 600 AD; and
                traced the 50 Generation Data and created Family Tree, which members claim back
                to the seventh century. The DANIS, who hail from Saurashtra, had a grand get-together
                of over 500 family members from across the world at Mahuwa in Gujarat on November
                2, 2008 where they formed the Nagar Bandhara Community and released a copy of their family
                tree.

            <h5>
                HOW IT STARTED ?</h5>
            <p>
                We decided to start working on our family history and held get-togethers (as many
                as 10),” said the Kutumb Mandal chairman Jayesh Dani. Initially a five-member committee
                was formed. The committee approached the family’s elders and got talking to them
                about their history. In fact, from just one member they got the list of a few generations.It
                wasn’t tough getting contact details of those abroad as the Gujarati community keeps
                a directory which mentions each member.The process took 18 months and at the end
                of it, the family had been traced to 50 generations. “It was a Herculean task, but
                the fruits were sweet,”</p>
            <h5>
                HOW THE DANIS TRAVELLED ?</h5>
            <p>
                The Dani family has traced their clan up to Anang Sha (about 600 AD) who migrated
                from the then marketplace of Ajmer in Rajasthan to Palanpur in Gujarat.His primary
                task was to collect transit tax on goods - roughly 2.5 per cent of the goods. At
                the end of the day, he was required to sell off the collected goods and deposit
                the proceeds to the state treasury. He would get commission from the proceeds. The
                family moved from Palanpur and Patan in Gujarat. The Danis stayed put in Patan,
                which was one of the richest towns in India then, despite plundering by Mohammed
                Ghazani, but later moved to Sri Nagar, which was then known as Paar-Khar (beyond
                desert). The family moved to Saurashtra around 1420 AD and then struck roots there.
                The long journey of the Danis thus ended at Gohilwad, Saurashtra, where many of
                the current descendants of the family live.
            </p>
            <h5>
                ORIGIN OF THE SURNAME</h5>
            <p>
                There were three main sources of income for the state - Aan, Dan and Khan (taxes
                and mining). The Danis had the responsibility of collecting transit dues on commerce
                within state. Those who collected taxes were named Dani. The task entrusted to the
                Danis was to collect 2.5 per cent tax on goods transiting through the state.
            </p>
            <h5>
                HOW THEY ARE PLACED TODAY ?</h5>
            <p>
                The DANIS are now spread across the world. In India most of the Mega cities you
                can find at least one DANI Family. And over 500 DANIS are settled in UK, US, Dubai
                and Singapore. In India in most Mega cities you can find at least one DANI Family.
