There was a king called Patai Raval who was ruling the Champaner which is situated in the foot of Pavagadh. That was the golden time of Pavagadh and Champaner as Ma MAhakali was residing there happily. Mahakali ma was not so dark at that time. But she was very beautiful, fair and pretty. She used to go to Chmpaner to play Garba. And Patai used to see her. He got attracted towards Mahakali Ma.


Bhadrakali Ma is elder sister of Mahakali Ma. Bhadrakali get to know that king is looking Mahakali with dirty looks so she stopped Mahakali to go for playing garba. But Mahakali refused to stay and went for playing garba. As Bhadrakali is elder sister and Mahakali didn't listened to her at all, She got upset and angry with Mahakali. And that's why she sat in opposite side of Mahakali. Still if you go to Pavagadh, You can see the temple of Bhadrakali which has Bhadrakali's Back towards Mahakali Temple.

After ignoring Bhadrakali, Mahakali went for playing garba. When she was playing garba, king Patai forgotten everything against her beauty and decided to make her queen of him. He just went to her with a dirty look and hold her Palav(sari). Mahakalai laughed and said "Poor king! Leave my sari. I m like your mother". But Patai said "No I wont leave you at all. I am going to make you my queen". Mahakali got very very angry and became too black and darker in anger and give him curse that Champaner and your complete kingdom will destroyed completely. Now no one can save you and your kingdom" After that curse Mohammad Begada attacked Champaner and won it. Patai got destroyed completely. Because of Mahakali curse Champaner was compelety destroyed and there was no people for long time..

After giving curse as a woman Mahakali feel embarrassed and felt that a man looked dirtily and talked like this with me. She thought I just want to diaper and fill in the earth. Soi she ran to Pavagadh and started filling in earth. But at the end Sandasah Pir (brother of  Mahakali) hold her hair and said "If you will be completely filled in the earth and disapear then who will honor you or who worship you? You have to be here and give blessings to your followers as you will be the Goddess of Kaliyug. So Mahakali stopped filling inside at the moment. So only eyes are apear and the whole body of Mahakali is in cave below the temple of Pavagadh. The look of Mahakali in the cave is too dangerous and scary. So nobody go there and as per the saying whoever see that get scared so much, he will be died at a moment.
